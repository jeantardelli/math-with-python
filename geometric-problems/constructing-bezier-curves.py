"""
Bezier curves, or B-splines, are a family of curves that are extremely useful
in vector graphics â€“ for instance, they are commonly used in high-quality font
packages. This is because they are defined by a small number of points that
can then be used to inexpensively calculate a large number of points along the
curve. This allows detail to be scaled according to the needs of the user.

This module illustrates how to create a simple class representing a Bezier
curve and compute a number of points along it.
