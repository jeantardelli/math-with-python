Applying Math with Python
=========================
This repo contains code that solves mathematical problems in Python and follows the introductionary guide on the [Applying Math with Python](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Applying-Math-with-Python) book.

Directories
===========

### [Basic Concepts and Functions](basic-concepts-and-functions)

This directory contains core mathematical concepts and structures and their Python representations. Some examples are basic numerical types, basic mathematical functions (i.e. trigonometric, exponentia, logarithms, etc), and matrices.

### [Mathematical Plotting with Matplotlib](mathematical-plotting-matplotlib)

This directory contains modules that plot functions and data in a variety of styles, creating figures that are fully labeled and annotated. Includes also three-dimensional plots and its customization.

### [Calculus and Differential Equations](calculus-and-differential-equations)

This directory contains various topics related to calculus such as polynomials, differentials and integrations, solving equations or system of equations and fast Fourier Transform for signals processing.

### [Randomness and Probability](randomness-and-probability)

This directoy contains code related to randomness and probability. Here you will find code that explores the fundamental of probability (such as selecting elements from a set of data) or (pseudo) random numbers generation. Some modules illustrates Bayesian techniques and Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters on a simple model.

### [Trees and Networks](trees-and-networks)

This directory contains code related to trees and networds. Networks are objects that contain nodes and edges between pairs of nodes. They can be used to represent a wide variety of real-world situations, such as distribution and scheduling. The modules contained here explore how to create, characterize and search minimal paths in networks.
